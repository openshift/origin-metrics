How metrics is installed has changed from using the deployer pod to using ansible.

== About

Origin Metrics is designed to gather container, pod and node metrics from across an entire OpenShift cluster. These metrics can then be viewed in the OpenShift Console or exported to another system.

It achieves this goals via these main components:

==== Heapster
link:https://github.com/kubernetes/heapster[Heapster] gathers the metrics from across the OpenShift cluster. It retrieves metadata associated with the cluster from the master API and retrieves individual metrics from the `/stats` endpoint which is exposed on each individual OpenShift node.

It gathers system level metrics such as CPU, Memory, Network, etc

Heapster will then send these metrics to Hawkular Metrics and expose a REST endpoint that the horizontal pod autoscaler (HPA) uses.

==== Hawkular Metrics
link:https://github.com/hawkular/hawkular-metrics/[Hawkular Metrics] is the metric storage engine from the link:http://www.hawkular.org/[Hawkular] project. It provides means of creating, accessing and managing historically stored metrics via an easy to use json based REST interface.

Hawkular Metrics uses Cassandra as its metric datastore.

It receives metrics from the Heapster component and is also used to expose metrics to the console and other third party systems.

==== Cassandra
link:http://cassandra.apache.org/[Cassandra] is the data store for Hawkular Metrics. It stores and persists all the metrics coming in from Hawkular Metrics.

==== Hawkular OpenShift Agent
The link:https://github.com/hawkular/hawkular-openshift-agent[Hawkular OpenShift Agent] is a component which can be used to gather application level metrics coming from pods. This allows pods themselves to expose metrics that they wish to be collected.

This component runs as a daemon set across the OpenShift cluster and is responsible for gathering application level metrics from each pod running on that node.

[NOTE]
====
The Hawkular OpenShift Agent is currently in Tech Preview.

== Before You Begin

The Metrics components requires that OpenShift is properly installed and configured. How to properly install and configure OpenShift is beyond the scope of this document. Please see the link:https://docs.openshift.org/latest/welcome/index.html[OpenShift documentation] on how to properly install and setup your system.

The metrics install requires integration with the OpenShift cluster and if there are installation or configuration problems with your OpenShift cluster you may encounter them when tyring to running metrics. Some of the more common issues are checked in the deployer pod and will give you an error message about your installation.

Please see the link:docs/troubleshooting.adoc[troubleshooting guide] for a complete list of things to watch out for.

== Installing

The link:https://docs.openshift.org/latest/install_config/cluster_metrics.html[OpenShift documentation] describes how to install metrics.

[NOTE]
====
The old way of deploying metrics which rely on using the deployer pod is now deprecated. For the old instructions please see the link:docs/deployer_installation.adoc[deployer installation page].
====

== Deploying the Hawkular OpenShift Agent

A few steps are required to deploy the link:https://github.com/hawkular/hawkular-openshift-agent[Hawkular OpenShift Agent] into OpenShift.

You will first need to create the ConfigMap that the Agent uses to configure itself:
----
$ oc create -f hawkular-agent/hawkular-openshift-agent-configmap.yaml -n openshift-infra
----

You will then need to process the Agent's template and deploy its components:
----
$ oc process -f hawkular-agent/hawkular-openshift-agent.yaml | oc create -n openshift-infra -f -
----

Finally you will need to grant the `hawkular-openshift-agent`'s service account the proper permissions:
----
$ oc adm policy add-cluster-role-to-user hawkular-openshift-agent system:serviceaccount:openshift-infra:hawkular-openshift-agent
----

Once this is completed, the `Hawkular OpenShift Agent` should be deployed into the `openshift-infra` project.

If you are running the latest OpenShift, you should be able to verify that the agent is functioning by seeing extra metrics showing up under the agent's pod metric page.

For instructions on how to expose custom metrics on your own pod and for more information about the agent itself, please the the link:https://github.com/hawkular/hawkular-openshift-agent[Hawkular OpenShift Agent] project.

== Accessing Metrics Directly

If you wish to access and manage metrics directly, you can do so via the Hawkular Metrics REST API. This will allow you to directly access the raw metrics data and export it for use in your own customized systems.

For more information please see the link:docs/hawkular_metrics.adoc[Hawkular Metrics] page.

== Accessing the Hawkular Metrics Python Client

The Hawkular Metrics pod has been configured so that the Hawkular Python client is installed and given admin priviledges by default. This will allow you to check and query metrics directly from within the Hawkular Metric pods.

The command to run the client is `client` and can be run from the terminal within the OpenShift console or via the `oc exec` command.

Please see the link:https://github.com/hawkular/hawkular-client-python[Hawkular Metrics python client project] for more information.

== Accessing Heapster Directly

The Heapster deployed as part of origin-metrics is configured to be only accessible via the API Proxy. Access will require either cluster-reader or cluster-admin privileges.

For example, to reach the Heapster `metrics` endpoint, you would need to access it by doing something like:

----
$ curl -H "Authorization: Bearer XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX" \
       -X GET https://${KUBERNETES_MASTER}/api/v1/proxy/namespaces/openshift-infra/services/https:heapster:/api/v1/model/metrics
----

For more information about Heapster and how to access its APIs, please refer the link:https://github.com/kubernetes/heapster/[Heapster] project.

== Cleanup

If you wish to undeploy and remove everything deployed by the deployer, the follow commands can be used:

----
$ oc delete all,secrets,sa,templates --selector=metrics-infra -n openshift-infra
----

[NOTE]
====
The persistent volume claim will not be deleted by the above command. If you wish to permanently delete the data in persistent storage you can run `oc delete pvc --selector=metrics-infra`
====

If you wish to remove the deployer's components themselves

----
$ oc delete sa,secret metrics-deployer -n openshift-infra
----


== Docker Containers

All the docker images for Origin Metric components are available at link:https://hub.docker.com/search/?q=openshift%2Forigin-metrics&page=1&isAutomated=0&isOfficial=0&starCount=0&pullCount=0[docker hub] and there should not be a need to build these directly.

If you wish to build your own images or hack on the project. Please see the link:docs/build.adoc[build instructions].

== Known Issues

Please see the link:docs/known_issues.adoc[known issues] page in the documentation.
